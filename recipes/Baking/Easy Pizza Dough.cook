In a #small bowl{} whisk the @warm water{3/2%cup}, @sugar{1%tsp}, and @yeast{9/4%tsp} together. Let it sit for about ~{10%minutes}. If the yeast is good, it will start to froth up.
In the bowl of your mixer, add the @flour{4%cups} and @salt{1%tsp}, @olive oil{1/3%cup} and yeast mixture. Mix everything together using the dough hook for about ~{5%minutes} or until the dough is soft and elastic. When it's done it will come clean from the side of the bowl.
Shape the dough into a ball and place in #an oiled bowl{}, rubbing oil on the dough as well, cover with #plastic wrap{} and refrigerate. If you're not using the dough right away, you can also freeze the dough.
